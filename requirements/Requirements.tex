	\begin{itemize}
		\item Super Users can:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Update Memberships
			\item Maintain a list of taboo words
			\item unlock locked documents
			\item process complaints about ou's
			\item have all privileges reserved for ou's inside any group
		\end{itemize}
		\item Ordinary Users can:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Create New documents- They own the documents they create.
			\item Invite other ou's to update documents they own.
			\item Decide whether the document is:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item open to the public (can be seen by everyone)
				\item restricted (can only be viewed as read-only by gu's and edited by ou's)
				\item shared (viewed/ edited by ou's who are invited)
				\item private
			\end{itemize} 
			\item accept/deny invitation(s) placed by other ou's for their specific documents
			\item lock a shared document for updating (only one ou can lock a document successfully and system should indicate which ou is updating the document)
			\item update a successfully locked document $\&$ assign a unique version sequence number $\&$ remember who made the update $\&$ when the update was made
			\item unlock a shared document locked by him/herself
			\item file complaints in two ways:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item to the owner of a document about another ou's update
				\item to the a SuperUser about the owner of the documents
			\end{enumerate} 
			\item if they own a document, they should deal with complaints filed by other ou's
			\item remove ou's who were invited before.
			\item unlock locked documents that s/he owns that is being updated by others (unlock documents locked by others as long as you are the owner)
			\item search own files based on keyword
			\item search information about other ou's based on name and/or interests.
			\item have all privileges for gu's
		\end{itemize}
		\item Guest users can:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item read open documents
			\item retrieve old versions of open documents
			\item retrieve complaints about old versions of documents
			\item send suggestions to Super Users about taboo words.
			\item apply to be an ordinary user, that will be \underline{confirmed or rejected by su} (in application, name and technical interests are submitted)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Constraints
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{only one current version of any document exists as current}
			\item for simplicity there is only one word for each line in all documents
			\item only the editing commands are saved for older versions with three possible actions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item add
				\item delete
				\item update
				\item \textbf{Example: For instance, if the file $doc_1$.txt contains one line "the", and $doc_2$.txt contains three lines "welcome \ n the \ n world \ n", then your system only saves $doc_2$.txt, $doc_1$.history saves the commands "delete 1; delete 3" which changes $doc_2$.txt into $doc_1$.txt. Your system generates the history command file based on the difference.}
			\end{itemize}
				\item retrieving old versions should be done by system based on current version and sequence of history files.
				\item words on taboo list (maintained by SU) are replaced by UNK by the system
				\begin{itemize}
					\item users who use words on taboo list are automatically warned \textbf{``user update the document next time you log into the system''} 
					\item until update is made by user all other activities are blocked for that user.
				\end{itemize}
