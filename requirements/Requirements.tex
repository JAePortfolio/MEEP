		\item [$\square$] \textbf{Constraints}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item [$\square$] \textbf{only one current version of any document exists as current}
			\item [$\square$] for simplicity there is only one word for each line in all documents
			\item [$\square$] only the editing commands are saved for older versions with three possible actions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item [$\square$] add
				\item [$\square$] delete
				\item [$\square$] update (replaces a word)
				\item \textbf{Example: For instance, if the file $doc_1$.txt contains one line "the", and $doc_2$.txt contains three lines "welcome /\ n the /\ n world /\ n", then your system only saves $doc_2$.txt, $doc_1$.history saves the commands "delete 1; delete 3" which changes $doc_2$.txt into $doc_1$.txt. Your system generates the history command file based on the difference.}
			\end{itemize}
				\item [$\square$] retrieving old versions should be done by system based on current version and sequence of history files.
				\item [$\square$] words on taboo list (maintained by SU) are replaced by UNK by the system
				\begin{itemize}
					\item [$\square$] users who use words on taboo list are automatically warned \textbf{``user update the document next time you log into the system''}
					\item [$\square$] until update is made by user all other activities are blocked for that user.
